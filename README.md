 Dear Moslem AJRA,

As part of the Lab Phase checkpoint, I am writing to confirm that I have decided to work individually on my project.

After reviewing the list of proposed project topics, I have selected the following:

ðŸ”¹ Project Title:  MERN Application ðŸ”¹ Working Format: Individual (working alone) ðŸ”¹ Draft GitHub Repository: https://github.com/wiem12627

The repository currently includes:

A redme.text file outlining the project objectives, key features, and tech stack

An initial folder structure (frontend/, backend/, docs/)

A planning.md file to document the project milestones and development phases

I will continue updating the repository throughout the Lab Phase with commits, implementations, and documentation as the project progresses.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to share any feedback or recommendations you may have to help guide my work.
